Generate a new complete Python file that performs the following tasks:

0. Ensure the code includes `import json` and `from io import StringIO` at the top.

1. Create an empty DataFrame with the columns 'Date', 'Close' and 'Drawdown'.

2. Do not populate the DataFrame and do not include SAMPLE DATA for the plots but include a comment stating 'df=TEMP_DATA'.

3. Convert the dataFrame index to a 'Date' column

4. Use matplotlib to create a plot with:
    * Display the closing value and the drawdown value in a subplot across the time period .
    * X-axis showing dates with intelligent labeling (e.g., only show year for multi-year data, month for multi-month data).
    * Appropriate labels, and legend
    * closing value line should be in blue 
    * drawdown value line should be in red
    * the title should be the word TITLE in capitals
    * there should be a gap between the chart for the plot and subplot

5. Display Plot
