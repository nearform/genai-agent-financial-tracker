Generate a new complete Python file that performs the following tasks:

0. Ensure the code includes `import json` and `from io import StringIO` at the top.

1. Create an empty DataFrame with the columns 'Date', 'Close' and 'Drawdown'.

2. Do not populate the DataFrame and do not include SAMPLE DATA for the plots but include a comment stating 'df=TEMP_DATA'.

3. Use matplotlib to create a plot with:
    * Display the closing value across the time period .
    * X-axis showing dates with intelligent labeling (e.g., only show year for multi-year data, month for multi-month data).
    * Appropriate labels, and legend
    * the title should be the word TITLE in capitals
    * there should be a subplot displaying the drawdown data over time in red 
    * there should be an empty space between the plot and subplot

4. Display Plot
